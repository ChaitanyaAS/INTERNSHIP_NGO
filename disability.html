                        On 25th August 2019, we visited Shastri School for Deaf and Dumb Children, a residential school with around 20 kids. We had a wonderful time interacting with these talented children, who impressed us with their drawing and painting skills. Lunch was sponsored by Janmamithra, followed by fun games that the kids thoroughly enjoyed. The day concluded with a cake-cutting ceremony and snacks distribution, creating cherished memories for all.

                        On 10th February 2019, Janmamithra organized a heartfelt event at Mathrushree Manovikasa Kendra, where we recognized the importance of using our abilities to support those who are less fortunate. While many of us are blessed with the five senses and the ability to express our emotions, there are others who face challenges in doing so. The event was a reminder that we can share our gifts by helping those in need explore ways to experience happiness and communicate their feelings. The time spent with these individuals reinforced the power of compassion and how we can make a meaningful difference in their lives. It was truly a day of reflection, learning, and giving.
