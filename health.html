                        "Let us remember the forgotten ones!" . It is a call to acknowledge and remember those who are often overlooked or neglected by society. It serves as a reminder to care for and show compassion towards people who may not always receive attention, whether due to their social status, age, or circumstances. The message encourages empathy and a sense of responsibility toward the well-being of others, particularly those in need or facing hardship. By reflecting on their struggles, we are reminded of our duty to uplift and support the marginalized in our communities. This sentiment calls for greater inclusivity and solidarity for those who are forgotten or left behind, ensuring no one is left out of the circle of care and support.
