                        Hunger is something no one should struggle with or judge for! At Janmamithra Trust, in association with the Rotaract Club of Vijayanagar, we took a noble initiative to support the underprivileged. We distributed food packets, sanitizers, and masks to those in need. Additionally, we created awareness about COVID-19, emphasizing hygiene and safety practices. This effort reflected our commitment to compassion and community support during challenging times.

                        The distribution of food packets is a thoughtful initiative aimed at addressing hunger and providing essential nourishment to those in need. It involves the preparation and delivery of wholesome meals to underserved communities, ensuring that individuals and families have access to basic sustenance. It highlights the importance of sharing resources and supporting those who face daily struggles, creating a positive impact and promoting socialÂ well-being.
