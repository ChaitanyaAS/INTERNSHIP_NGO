                        On Independence Day, our Janmamithra team organized a heartfelt celebration at the Government school we proudly adopted in July 2018. The event was filled with patriotic fervor, as students, teachers, and our dedicated volunteers came together to honor the nation’s freedom.

Our volunteers actively engaged with the students, encouraging them to reflect on the sacrifices of freedom fighters and the importance of being responsible citizens. The celebration fostered a deep sense of unity, pride, and commitment among everyone present, making it a memorable and impactful day for all.

                        Children’s Day, also known as Bal Divas, is celebrated on the birthday of India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, who was affectionately called ‘Chacha Nehru’. This day emphasizes the importance of love, education, and affection for children, acknowledging that childhood is a time of innocence and playfulness. As Dr. Haim Ginott wisely said, "Children are like wet cement; whatever falls on them makes an impression." It is crucial to understand that every child has a unique learning style and pace, and they are all capable of succeeding when encouraged. Rather than focusing on how quickly a child learns, we should foster curiosity and a love for learning, which will last a lifetime and contribute to building a strong, educated nation. By nurturing curiosity, we are not just teaching them lessons but empowering them to continue their learning journey forever.

On another visit, we celebrated the birthday of Sharath, the founder of Janmamithra, by sponsoring lunch for the children and conducting mind games that challenged their thinking. The event concluded with the distribution of sweets and chocolates, leaving the children with happy memories and our team feeling inspired for future events.
